This package is a collection of commonly-used tools in Climate Science. This is mainly a work-in-progress package, developed for myself and is available here, for _common-good_ purpose as well as for archive purpose. Nothing fancy here, basics of climate field analysis will be covered, with some forays into some _"state-of-the-art"_ techniques.

## Objectives

* Visualization of NetCDF files (e.g. temporal mean of a given NetCDF file), for rapid evaluation of NetCDF files
* Migration of NetCDF files to Julia matrix
* Climate indices from The joint CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team (ET) on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI)
* Post-processing of climate timeseries using Quantile-Quantile mapping methods (cf. Pani et al. 2010)

## Examples

Coming soon.
