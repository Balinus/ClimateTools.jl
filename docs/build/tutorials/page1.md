## Objectives


  * Visualization of NetCDF files (e.g. temporal mean of a given NetCDF file), for rapid evaluation of NetCDF files
  * Migration of NetCDF files to Julia matrix
  * Climate indices from The joint CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team (ET) on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI)
  * Post-processing of climate timeseries using Quantile-Quantile mapping methods (cf. Pani et al. 2010)
